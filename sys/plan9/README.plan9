We are using the Plan9 Ansi Posix Environment (APE), pdcurses and lua.
The port assumes that you have built and installed pdcurses and lua and that your header files have the #pragma lib .

The plan9 port is using a lot from "unix", but we do not have tty so we depend on curses.

To build, just run mk in his directory.
 
TODO in the future: A native /dev/draw windowing system for NetHack to have a more native-looking client with more advanced graphics capabilities.
